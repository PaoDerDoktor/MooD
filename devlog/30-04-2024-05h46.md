Okay so I decided to do a little devlogg thing for once (always wanted to but never found any good way / opportunity to build one). It's dedicated to log approaches, reflexions, etc. It's intended to be read by me, and people who are curious about the project.

Disclaimer : My keyboard is reaaaaally bad. It often registers double, sometimes triple inputs, and I don't want to break my stream of thinking by corrrecting and rereading all the time, so typos will most likely exist. Feel free to report them as issues ! I'm also mildly dumb so some things there will most likely not make any sense, but that's ok !

MooD is actually a really simple wordplay on DooM. Why ? Because I thought about creating a game while playing [Atlus' 1998's Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_(video_game)), and the simple idea of a first person blocky game became an obsession. I decided to go with Raylib because I wanted to learn it after hearing about it from [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/c/Tsoding).
So what's the link between this story and DooM ? Well, DooM is first person too, and I really needed a quick name. It basically ran through my mind. That's all !

Anyways, I actually created the project's folder a long long time ago, but due to mental health issues, I decided to work on it later. Yesterday morning, I thought about giving it a try, and here I am, almost 24 hours later, on a sleepless night (my sleeping schedule is fucked up, I'm badly sick).

I decided to rotate the project a bit : I don't really want to make it a dungeon crawler nor an FPS anymore : I want to build a full fledged voxel engine to run a game. I'm not really sure where I'm going with it yet : it's not my main project, as I'm working on "59XX-D", a dungeon crawler on godot that I intend to sell in order to like, stay alive a bit without risking mentally decaying even morrre working a 9-5 (adhd and autism joy).

If you'd ask me now, here's a list of what games I think about while working on "MooD" currently :

|     Name    | Why ?                                                                                                                                       |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Noita    | Noita's a 2D roguelike where every pixel is simulated, akin to a sand game. This seems powerful.                                            |
|   Teardown  | I like the fact that Teardown is basically a mater interaction simulator, but I dislike the fact that I found it quite empty after a while. |
|    Hytale   | Hypixel's promising a game with endless possibilities, many gameplay types. I'd like to implement something like this.                      |
|  Minecraft  | Well... It's minecraft, I mean.. Hard to do a voxel thing past 2010 without thinking about it. I want to go beyond it though.               |
| The Sandbox | The sandbox had some cool electricity components that I'd like to replicate.                                                                |
|   Minetest  | Minetest is whhat I'd describe as a wonderful idea that's sadly a bit undercooked.                                                          |

This is some kind of a challenge for me :

- I never fully built any engine by now (Hephaistos is my closest attempt)
- I forced myself to write in C without any library apart from Raylib
- I don't know much about the technical specificities of voxel engines
- I'm really bad at graphics
- I don't know much about raylib

Today, I managed to build some kind of a small start "boilerplate" caable of taking a cube wavefront OBJ file I built on blender, a png texture I built on piskel, and render it correctly. Pretty cool !

So yeah. Here's pretty much everyhting I have to say about the last 24h.

It's now 6:11 AM as I finished writing this. I kinda need a small pause, but I'll come back later. The next plan is to explore how I can do to render more voxels in an efficient way. The "keyconcepts" I have in mind right now are :

- Sparse voxel octrees
- Brickmapping
- Greedy mesher

I'll go browse on reddit and other sources for clues/tips/good practices. I'll also try to commit this real quick. See you guys in another file !
